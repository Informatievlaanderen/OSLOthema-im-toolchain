# OSLOthema-Toolchain


This repository hosts the implementation model documenting the internal structures of the OSLO toolchain.
In particular it documents the resulting data model that is created after extracting information from an UML model.

This implementation model is the information that can be collected about any dataspecification in a formal way.
And based on this standard artefact renderers can be made.
